  counting and using the metronome, and how you can do the same with these
  ancient piano methods.

# üèÜ Increase Finger Speed

## Student increases Finger Speed by 52% in 3 weeks \(using this Ancient method\)

{% hint style="success" %}
1. Igli achieved a **52% increase in speed** by counting out loud with the metronome.
2. Igli started at less than 100bpm, with **uneven notes and no counting.** 
3. Igli is now able to ****achieve **100% accuracy at more than 152bpm**
{% endhint %}

### What is the ancient method?

Hanon exercises, est. since 1873 \(included in every level üòâ\)

{% page-ref page="../guides/basics/hanon.md" %}

I'd like you to meet student [@iglikullolli](https://www.instagram.com/iglikullolli/) from Albania

### **Before**

Here's how Igli went from...

> I feel depressed... I don't have support... my hands are shaking and I can't concentrate"

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Metronome is on**, but not playing on time.  
**Not counting out loud,** unsure where notes align.

### Ôªø**After**

And transformed his technique into this...

> "You're going to make me cry, I'm speechless for real"

###  **üèÜ Achievement**

This is Hanon No. 6 at **172 bpm** - one of the fastest tempos on the metronome.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Playing with the metronome** - not before the tick, not after, but ON the tick. 

**Counting out loud -** if you can say you can play it

**Counting subdivisions** - in this case, that's sixteenth notes: 1e+a 2e+a 3e+a 4e+a 
{% endhint %}

## **The Problem**

Here are the facts:

![](https://i.gyazo.com/c506c9097a2f1b46bbfa62bae5149098.png)





* I met Igli in Sep 2020
* Igli loves to play repertoire like River Flows in You, Mariage D'amour, but there was a huge issue...

{% hint style="danger" %}
Igli's playing was **messy, uneven, and his fingers felt weak.**  
He did not know how to count or use a metronome.
{% endhint %}

  
ÔªøThis is River Flows In You. 

Ever ask yourself "why doesn't my playing sound as good as that YouTube video?"

Igli had this problem:

{% embed url="https://coachtestprep.s3.amazonaws.com/direct-uploads/user-76755/d8c40095-9c22-47cd-a5b3-53643e45488c/river%20flows%20in%20you%20@iglikullolli%20dec%202020.mp4" %}

  
Igli was passionate about piano...  
But his weaknesses made him feel depressed and lost...  
  
He knew he had a problem and wanted to fix it, so...  


![](https://i.gyazo.com/d1792ab867d03e5e8c1a2fbcddc84a74.png)

* Igli joined our program in Dec 2020
* He had never counted out loud... 
* He had never done a single piano technique drill...  

## **The Solution**  

![](https://i.gyazo.com/c8944fcb1153b7d586bf1a41813a1cb7.png)

\*\*\*\*

### **Faster Fingers in 3 Weeks**

1. Igli achieved a 52% increase in speed by counting out loud with the metronome by Hanon No. 6.
2. Igli started at less than 100bpm, with uneven notes and no counting. 
3. Igli is now able to achieve 100% accuracy at 152bpm.

## **WEEK 1**

After learning Hanon No. 1 to 5 in Level 1...  
  
Igli started Hanon No. 6 with a metronome...

![](https://i.gyazo.com/745395853f2fabff245cba0ee2177309.png)

Like everyone else, he struggled to play in time with the metronome, so

* he clapped
* he counted out loud
* he set the metronome to 72bpm  \(1 tick = 1/16th note\)

### **72bpm**

###  **88bpm**

He had trouble making transitions in time...

## **WEEK 2**

Dec 16, 2020

1 week later, Igli is playing Hanon No. 6 at 96bpm and 112bpm. 

### **96bpm**

{% hint style="info" %}
Watch his fingers begin to develop strength.
{% endhint %}

{% embed url="https://coachtestprep.s3.amazonaws.com/direct-uploads/user-76755/d325acce-f083-4ab6-a638-07f83efb9f68/Hanon%20No.%206%20@iglikullolli%20Dec%2016%202020%20\(96bpm\).mp4" %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Here's what Igli is doing right so far:

* It's hard, but he **counts out loud**
* He masters accuracy **at each metronome speed**
* **When comfortable**, he increases the speed \(1 tick = 1/16th note\)
{% endhint %}

##   **WEEK 3** 

By Dec 28, Igli is playing Hanon No. 6 at a stable speed of 120bpm.  
  
Watch his fingers with control.  


### 120 bpm

{% hint style="success" %}
**Seeing how stable he is**, we decide to push for 144bpm, and 152bpm to the sixteenth note  
\(1 tick = 1/16th note\)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Nearly there, but still raw**. Needs more repetition.

****Now you might be wondering...  
****What is student @iglikullolli up to now? Why is he trying to play faster?

## **The Dream**

Since I met Igli in September 2020....

@iglikulloli's dream was to play [Maksim Mrvica's version of Pirates of the Caribbean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWnrQFtTMI4)



![](https://i.gyazo.com/516b486c1655966989145e92618e70c3.png)

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWnrQFtTMI4" %}



If he wants to play this, he needs to learn how to count and play with the metronome.

This piece is fast.

To achieve this, he needs to:

* learn how to count in 12/8 time 
* learn how to count with the metronome
* improve his finger speed + controlÔªøÔªø

![](https://i.gyazo.com/a9a13271cde63e80f16b8c7e1626330a.png)

##  **What can you learn from this?**

  
Like a lot of self taught pianists, Igli has lots of songs and piece he likes. He loves playing repertoire like:

* River Flows in You
* Mariage D'amour
* Chopin Nocturne No. 20  

But he suffered from 2 main problems:  


### **1. Slow Finger Syndrome üñê**ÔªøÔªøÔªøÔªø

**Slow Finger Syndrome is easy to fix** if you know what to practice  


![](https://i.gyazo.com/47e0346820a23734fced05fd54384586.png)

**If you want to:**

* have no problem playing 95% of all sheet music online... 
* play with evenness and 100% rhythm accuracy   

**You just have to:**

* practice Hanon with the metronome + count
* master a minimum of Hanon No. 1 to 31

  
If you can master a new exercise from Hanon every week, you will finish Level 10 in less than 1 year.  
  
  


### **2.** **Low Progress Disorder**Ôªø Ôªø**üß†üéπ** 

Symptoms of low progress disorder:

Here's what I said...

{% hint style="success" %}
You're 7 months in **playing something that took me 7 years.** You're doing fine.
{% endhint %}

![](https://i.gyazo.com/d6b44c2fad12caa0642611ec891fb58e.png)

## **Your Practice Plan**

  
Here's the plan:

* Level 0 Technique - Hanon No. 1 to 5  
* Level 1 Technique - Hanon No. 6 to 10 \(current\)

  
If Igli can achieve a speed increase of 52% by the 6th Hanon exercise, all you need to do is:  


* Practice a exercise Hanon daily \(3-5 reps\)
* Count out loud
* Use a metronome

###   **"But I practice a lot!"**

  
****If you still see no results with a lot of practice...  
It's not HOW MUCH you practice, it's HOW you practice.ÔªøÔªø  
  
  
Check your form, check your counting.  
Don't build bad habits, it will take time to undo them.
