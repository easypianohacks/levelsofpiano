Common questions...



## Why are there 2 treble clefs?

> The biggest question I have is why does it says Right and Left hand but both of the signs are Treble Clef? Is not the one for the left hand is supposed to be Bass Clef?

Left hand plays because the grand staff says to play with both hands.

LH doesn't need to always play bass clef  
If there's a treble clef in the left hand, the left hand will play notes in the treble clef





## How do I play the repeat signs?

Luna, a student asks:

> I understand this sign means to repeat again   
> But just needed to confirm, we only repeat once, yes?   
> Meaning we need to play it twice? Or as many repetitions that we like?

Repeat sign tells you to repeat once to the beginning, or the nearest repeat sign 

So you will: 

1. Play to the first repeat sign \(mm. 8\), repeat to the beginning \(mm. 1\) 
2. Then play to the end \(mm. 16\), then repeat to the nearest repeat sign \(mm. 9, beginning of 2nd line\), 
3. Then play to the end \(mm. 16\).

mm = measure number   
  
ex. measure number 1 = mm. 1
