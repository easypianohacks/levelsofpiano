# Student Feedback ft. Kavinvit @k7n3wt0n

The most common mistakes made in this piece = not respecting the legato + staccatos.

If you master this piece, you will know when to hold / play smoothly, and when to detach / staccato.

### **1st slur \(blue\)** 

not clear enough, you let go before you play C. your pinky needs to stay down. it will feel like both keys are down for a split second 

### **2nd slur \(blue\)**

it was okay 

### 3rd slur \(blue\)

the slur continues until F. You already let go on D... you need to play smoothly until the F on the next line. look closer at the music

### **4th slur \(blue\)**

Use the right fingering. You play A C smooth, then let go too early. You need to play A C B flat..... all smooth
