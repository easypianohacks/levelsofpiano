## **Why do we need to count?**

{% hint style="success" %}
If you can **play music without 0 wrong notes and 0 rhythm issues,**   
you can skip this part and do whatever you like.
{% endhint %}

For everyone else including me...

{% hint style="danger" %}
**If you play wrong notes...**  chances are you aren't playing notes on time either.
{% endhint %}

We count because we want to:

* keep in time, have perfect rhythm
* know exactly when to play
* play in sync with both hands
* play in sync with others

## **How do you play in time?**

Musicians use a metronome to play in time

### **What's a metronome?**

These days you can [download a metronome app](https://www.soundbrenner.com/the-metronome-app) or buy one on Amazon.

* A metronome makes even "ticks" at a set speed.
* These "ticks" correspond to the beat of the music 
* The speed is measured in bpm \(beats per minute\)

##  **What is a time signature?**

Ex. Sheet music has time signatures, the fraction looking numbers at the beginning of the music.

### Example 1

This example is in 2/4 time  


* Top Number = 2 = 2 beats in each bar
* Bottom Number = 1/4 = quarter note is 1 beat

### Example 2

This example is in 4/4 time  
  


* Top Number = 4 = 4 beats in each bar
* Bottom Number = 1/4 = quarter note is 1 beat

### Example 3

  
This example is in 3/4 time  
  


* Top Number = 3 = 3 beats in each bar
* Bottom Number = 1/4 = quarter note is 1 beat

## **What is the "note = number"?**

That's a metronome marking, the note above the music with a number, sometimes beside an [Italian tempo description like Allegretto, Allegro, and more](http://www.goodwinshighend.com/music/classical/tempo_glossary.htm)  
  
In this case, the sheet music is to be performed at a metronome speed of:  
  


> 112 - 126 to the quarter note.

  
At each tick, you must play 1 quarter note worth of music.  
  
To count with the metronome, you can say:  
  


* 1       2        3

  
If you count in subdivisions, like counting the 1/8th or 1/16th notes, the ticks on the metronome would align with the numbers:  
  


* 1  +   2  +   3  + 
* 1e+a 2e+a 3e+a

  
  
**I tried, but why is it so hard?**  
You want to be able to play with the metronome.  
Most people find it hard to do, or don't know they're not playing with the metronome.  
  
This is because there is lag between:

* when you want your fingers to play, and 
* when your fingers actually play

  
  
  
**How do we play with the metronome?**Here are 3 steps you must master in order:  
  


1. Count out loud with the metronome
2. Count + clap with the metronome
3. Count + play with the metronome

  
  
**If you can say it, you can play it**You can only play as fast as you can count out loud  
If you play faster than you count, you have no control, which is why your rhythm will sound uneven  
  
If you keep under control, you rhythm will be even and measured, like you have a metronome inside you  
  
  
**Successful Results**

**Here's a Relatable Story**  
As you may know, I answer a lot of questions in the Instagram DMs.  
  
Here's an example of a conversation with Vitaly, a student struggling to learn to count on his first day.  
![](https://i.gyazo.com/45668a17b579074d50f471c51d350e2d.png)  
  
Sometimes we work on 1-2 bars for an entire 2 hour practice session.   
  
If you want to:

* play beautifully like the people you hear online, and 
* you've never taken any piano lessons, you're in for a reality check!

**Does Jarrod Radnich count?**  
Does \(any good musician\) count?  
Vitaly didn't seem convinced.  
![](https://i.gyazo.com/e96c5cef20465e7e84f45fef175955d9.png)  
  
First of all, Jarrod Radnich most definitely counts.  
  
If you want to play[ Pirates arranged by Jarrod Radnich,](https://youtu.be/Eg0DFFsRaZQ?t=150) you'll need to count in 12/8 time, and 3/4 time.
