## Fear of Judgement

Why does our performance fall apart when we play in public?  
Even if we have 10+ years of practice experience?

**This is the fear of judgement.** 

We perform worse in public than when we perform in private because we care what other people might think. 

We think we risk public embarrassment. We imagine everyone laughing at us for making mistakes.

### The Solution

In short:

{% hint style="success" %}
Practice **at home** = Good **at home**  
Practice **in public** = Good **in public**
{% endhint %}

You must practice performing to get good at performing.



## From Fear to a Standing Ovation

This is the story of how I stopped being afraid of performing in public.  
I went from being a piano teacher afraid to admit his fear of performing in front of people...

To getting "standing ovations" in public.  
This is how you can overcome performance anxiety.

### August 2009

After 20 years of playing, and having never gotten over my fear of performing in public...

I decided to brave my fears one summer day in August 2019...



{% hint style="danger" %}
**The most exciting part -** approaching the bench can make you feel nervous at first.   
  
**Want to not feel nervous?** It's actually all in your head.   
If you're nervous, you actually need to fail at least once.   
  
That's right - you need to **prove to yourself nothing bad happens**  
  
Once I did this, I knew that the worse that could happen is **people walk on by and don't care.**

{% hint style="success" %}
**If you make mistakes, nobody even notices.** Other people have their own anxiety.   
I made a quite a few mistakes in this video. You probably couldn't even tell.   
  
If you could tell, it's not like your self esteem is so invested in telling other people they played something wrong, is it? Takes a lot of courage for most people to perform.   
  
Anyone who actually "hates on you" has to have _a lot of pain_ inside in order for them to lash out and show you how they feel.

### September 2009

Having realized nothing bad happens, I got momentum from my performance in Vancouver... 

While travelling in San Francisco, I stumbled upon a beautiful white Yamaha grand piano.

This time...

Instead of feeling fear, I felt excitement as I approached the bench.

You'll want to play at least 3 different pieces. 

1. **Grab Attention**  I warmed up with something to get people's attention.  In my case, that's Fantaisie Impromptu.   A couple people stopped to watch. 
2. **Draw the Crowd** Play some recognizable, popular tunes that people know. Let the crowd grow and accumulate. ****
3.

It wasn't until I finished performing
