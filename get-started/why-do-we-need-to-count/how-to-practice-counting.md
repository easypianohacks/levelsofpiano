# üîÑ How to Practice Counting

## **Examples**

Since the quarter note[![quarter note](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Figure_rythmique_noire_hampe_haut.svg/6px-Figure_rythmique_noire_hampe_haut.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Figure_rythmique_noire_hampe_haut.svg) = 1 beat, you would count the numbers with the quarter notes.  
Since there are only 3 beats in 1 bar, you would could only 3 beats in each bar.

****You want to be able to play with the metronome.  
Most people find it hard to do, or don't know they're not playing with the metronome.  
  
This is because there is lag between:

* when you want your fingers to play, and 
* when your fingers actually play

## **How do we count + play with the metronome?**

Here are 3 steps you must master in order:

1. Count out loud with the metronome
2. Count + clap with the metronome
3. Count + play with the metronome

###  **If you can say it, you can play it**

You can only play as fast as you can count out loud**.**  
If you play faster than you count, **you have no control,** which is why your rhythm will sound uneven  
  
If you keep under control, you rhythm will be even and measured, like you have a metronome inside you

Having trouble learning to count? So did MK.

* MK is one of my adult students
* MK has had rhythm problems for 7 years

Counting was super hard for her until she did this:

## **Relatable Story**

  
****As you may know, I answer a lot of questions in the Instagram DMs.  
  
Here's an example of a conversation with Vitaly, a student struggling to learn to count on his first day.

Sometimes we work on 1-2 bars for an entire 2 hour practice session.   
  
If you want to:

* play beautifully like the people you hear online, and 
* you've never taken any piano lessons, you're in for a reality check!

### **Does Jarrod Radnich count?**

  
****Does \(any good musician\) count?  
Vitaly didn't seem convinced.

First of all, Jarrod Radnich most definitely counts.  
  
If you want to play[ Pirates arranged by Jarrod Radnich,](https://youtu.be/Eg0DFFsRaZQ?t=150) you'll need to count in 12/8 time, and 3/4 time.

## How do I count triplets, tuplets or syncopation?

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2879%29.png)

> I got a good knowledge in music theory in general since I've always interested in it, but something I struggle now is counting out loud‚ù§Ô∏èThe problem of counting out loud is when the rhythm changes, with triplets or syncopations for example.

1. Write out the count numbers on the page
2. You must already know how to count out loud while playing 
3. For triplets, the main beat is on the 1st of the 3 notes, so count:  1 haha 2 haha 3 haha 4 haha    OR 1  +  a  2  +  a   3 +  a   4  + a       OR 1          2            3           4

### **Example 1**

### **Example 2** 

For example, in these bars you have: 

* a quarter note
* a sextuplet 
* a triplet
