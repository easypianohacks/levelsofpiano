#### Does **hand and wrist** position make a difference? 

**Your wrists should be level.** If your wrists bend way up or way down, it's because your fingers aren't strong enough, and your over-compensating with your arms.

{% hint style="danger" %}
This is because you are playing too fast to keep up good form.   
You will hurt yourself painfully if this continues. You will also limit your speed.

{% hint style="success" %}
This is because you are playing slow enough to keep up good form.  
You will have healthy, strong fingers that can play fast and accurately this way.

## The Keys

![](https://i.gyazo.com/587f0b6a00980c32677e9b39519328d2.gif)

There are 88 keys on the piano, but only 7 unique letters: ABCDEFG

Instead of memorizing the keys at first, there is an easier way to understand:

* Groups of 2
* Groups of 3

### Groups of 2 \(CDE\)

At each group of 2, you will find CDE.

### Groups of 3 \(FGAB\)

At each group of 3, you will find FGAB.

### The Keyboard

Now you can find the 30 most common notes on the keyboard.

## The Note

It's easy to read the note names next to each other, but this can be slow.

To read faster, we want to read in skips, not steps.  
We can skip lines & spaces to remember where each note belongs on the sheet music.

### FACE

F skips over G to A  
A skips over B to C  
C skips over D to E

FACE is easy to remember.

### EGBDF

E skips over F to G  
G skips over A to B  
B skips over C to D  
D skips over E to F

Use the acronym "Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge"
