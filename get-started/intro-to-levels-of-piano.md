# üéπ Intro to Levels of Piano

## "**Nobody made a comprehensive book to help you get to Fur Elise. Everyone just made beginner piano books."**

Until now üòâ

## **What can I expect to achieve?** 

### **1. Realistic Expectations**

There's no way anyone can teach you everything about piano in 10 weeks. Piano is a lifelong journey.   
  
In these 10 weeks, you will learn the 10 levels of piano you must master if you wish to play piano well.   
  
**EasyPianoHacks is a movement.** Once you join this movement, you know:

### 2. Tools to Teach Yourself

I can only offer you the mindset and perspective 

{% hint style="success" %}
How to break down a difficult sheet of music making it **so EASY to practice, it'll look like you're HACKING.**
{% endhint %}

The hard work you put in will make it look like you're hacking.  
  


### 3. Tell you when you're wrong

The best thing my teachers have ever done for me - they told me I was wrong.

If you want to develop 

* a good ear for what is right or wrong, or
* good taste for what is good or bad...

{% hint style="success" %}
You need someone with more experience to tell you:

* when you suck
* why you suck
* how to not suck 
{% endhint %}

Otherwise, you'll be that person playing the piano thinking you sound great...  
And you might sound great to people who are tone deaf...

But you wonder why your videos don't get you as many views or followers  
But you wonder why your version of the music doesn't sound like the one on YouTube  
  
And deep down you know there's something about your playing that could be improved...  
  
If nobody already left comments hating on your video...   
You wonder why nobody had the heart to say it to your face.  
  
You don't want to be that person.

Let's do something about it.

## **What you will learn**

Some of us don't have access to or can't afford the luxury of a private piano teacher.   
In 10 weeks, you will learn to think like a piano teacher. 

The **difference between this EasyPianoHacks and other alternatives** is you will learn:

* exactly what to practice on piano
* how to improve on your own
* apply this method to learn any piano sheet music
