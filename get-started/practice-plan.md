## **60 Minute Practice Plan** 

We will begin warming up our fingers for speed and control using Hanon.   
  
Rumor has it, students from Russian conservatories often only play Hanon for 5 years before playing a single melody. These students come out with a mastery of control and speed on the keyboard.

## **What if I don't have 60 minutes?**

Spending 15 to 30 minutes every day is better than not practicing, but you get the results that you put in.  


## **Can I play other songs or sheet music?**

Yes, please practice your favorite sheet music after these 60 minutes. 

* This practice plan = daily workout routine. Give you the fitness required to learn any sheet music. 
* Your favorite music = the sport. What we train our fitness for. The fun part.

  
Once you finish, you will be warmed up and better able to make progress in any pieces you play afterwards.
