# 🌲 Piano Skill Tree

## **Piano, The Game**

Our piano journey together will be like a video game.  
  
Every Level has _**Skills**_ you need to master to progress without feeling like piano music is impossible to learn.

We will begin by improving the 3 weakest areas of online piano students:

## **Skill Tree**

🎹 **Repertoire** - how well you can sound 

🎼 **Sight Reading -** how fast you can read 

🖐 **Technique** - how fast you can play 

## Technique 

#### **Learn to play faster, with agility and control.**

Music is made of keys, scales, chords, and arpeggios. Mastering these will help you learn music faster, and make less mistakes.

## Sight Reading 

#### Learn to read sheet music like reading English.

Most people can't read sheet music. Little do they know, reading sheet music is easier than learning English. If you want to read English faster, you read more books. If you want to play any sheet music, you just need to read more music.

## Repertoire

#### Learn what pieces to practice to advance your skill.

Feel lost? Do you practice every day but never get anywhere? 

> It's not just _**how much**_ ****you practice, it's also _**how**_ you practice.

This series shows you what you are doing wrong, with step-by-step videos from Level 1 to 10.
