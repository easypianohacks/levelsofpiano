# 🥁 Rhythm

## 🤷🏽I need help with counting and keeping up with the right rhythm.

### I would begin by learning to count while you play. 

1. Download a [metronome app ](https://www.soundbrenner.com/the-metronome-app)

2. Set it to 100 bpm 

3. Clap with each tick 

4. Count with each clap 🗣️ 1 2 3 4 repeat 

5. Play middle C with each tick counting 🗣️ 1 2 3 4 6. 

Play C D E F G F E D C with each tick while counting 🗣️ 1 2 3 4 7. 

Once this is easy, send me a video, then learn Hanon No. 1

## Am I using the metronome correctly?

### When you are struggling to match the metronome: 

1. Slow it down so you can hear each tick match the notes \(the tempo is too fast if you are slower than the metronome\)
2. Clap with each tick
3. Then count AND clap with each tick
4. Then play middle C with each tick AND count 
5. Then play C major scale slowly with each tick AND count

#### 🗣️ If you count loud while you play \(1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4\), you will match because our voices are trained more than our fingers, so we must count out loud to sync our fingers with our minds.
