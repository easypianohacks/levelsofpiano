### When to Stop Using Metronome 

**Metronome for LIFE**

You develop a better internal metronome as you use it more  
I still use it

**Like how long one is dependent on a ruler...same thing**

## Struggling to match the metronome?

### How to use the metronome correctly

1. **Slow down** so you can hear each tick match the notes \(the tempo is too fast if you are slower than the metronome\)
2. **Clap** with each tick
3. Then **count AND clap** with each tick
4. Then **play middle C** with each tick **AND count** 
5. Then **play C major scale slowly** with each tick **AND count**

#### üó£Ô∏è If you count loud while you play \(1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4\)

You will match because our voices are trained more than our fingers, so we must count out loud to sync our fingers with our minds.

Triplet = 3 notes = 1 quarter note

## How to play Alberti Bass fast and comfortably

### **1. Perfect the form slowly and firmly**

**Play firmly and feel each key press  
U**se staccato if you are uneven  
Be strict with yourself...practice every day

### **2. Work your way up like a video game**

**Play with the metronome every day - 10 Reps slow/1 Rep fast**   
Once you can consistently play it accurately, you can take it to the next level  
Start at 52 bpm and work up to 72 bpm, then 100 bpm

{% hint style="success" %}
**The more you do the slow work, the higher the quality and consistency**

This is NOT a beginner thing. I do this ALL OF THE TIME.
