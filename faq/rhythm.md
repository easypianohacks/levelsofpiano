# ü•Å Rhythm

## I need help with counting and keeping up with the right rhythm.

I would begin by learning to count while you play. 

1. Download a [metronome app ](https://www.soundbrenner.com/the-metronome-app)

2. Set it to 100 bpm 

3. Clap with each tick 

4. Count with each clap 1 2 3 4 repeat 

5. Play middle C with each tick counting 1 2 3 4 6. 

Play C D E F G F E D C with each tick while counting 1 2 3 4 7. 

Once this is easy, send me a video, then learn Hanon No. 1
