# ðŸŽ¼ Sight Reading

## Should a pianist look at their hands or at the sheet music while playing? Is it a bad thing to play by memory?

### ðŸ¤² ðŸŽ¼ðŸ§  A pianist will look at all 3.

#### You will look at your hands, the sheet music, and from memory.

The times when we look at our hands and the sheet music are when we are learning, to check our placement, fingering, reaching to chords, low notes, and high notes.

**If you want to improve your reading ability and familiarity with the keys, a good method is to stop looking at your hands and only focus on the sheet music.** You will be able to learn new sheet music easier because you won't be looking up and down as much - you will have a skill for playing without looking down at your hands.
