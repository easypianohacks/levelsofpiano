# ðŸŽ¼ Sight Reading

## Should a pianist look at their hands or at the sheet music while playing? Is it a bad thing to play by memory?

### ðŸ¤² ðŸŽ¼ ðŸ§  A pianist will look at all 3.

**You will look at your hands, the sheet music, and from memory.**  
The times when we look at our hands and the sheet music are when we are learning, to check our placement, fingering, reaching to chords, low notes, and high notes.

**If you want to improve your reading ability and familiarity with the keys, a good method is to stop looking at your hands and only focus on the sheet music.** You will be able to learn new sheet music easier because you won't be looking up and down as much - you will have a skill for playing without looking down at your hands.

## I struggle when it comes to sight reading anything with more than 3 notes per bar.

**It takes me a lot of time to learn new pieces** \(usually below my technique level\).   
This is frustrating because I feel this is holding back my progress.

Learning piano without reading notes

## How can I learn to play new styles **of** music and start to freestyle?

### 1. Build up your music vocabulary by reading new music

**Music is a language. Read a lot of music, play a lot of music.**   
It's like learning English. You have to read a lot of books. If you've always read non-fiction, maybe try fiction.

**Pick pieces or songs that you like.**   
Find the sheet music for them, and start learning them even if they're super easy. 

### 2. Freestyle or improvisation is like writing or speaking

**If you are a 3rd grader learning English, you won't have the vocabulary or sentence structure of a 12th grader.**   
Same with Piano. You want to build up your music vocabulary by reading new music. 

**Take the elements from each piece you learn like words or phrases from each book you read.**   
You will eventually be able to freestyle your own stuff on the spot.
