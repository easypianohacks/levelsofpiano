# 🎼 Sight Reading

## Should I look at my hands, sheet music, or play by memory?

### 🤲 🎼 🧠 A pianist will do all 3

**You will look at your hands, the sheet music, and from memory**  
The times when we look at our hands and the sheet music are when we are learning, to check our placement, fingering, reaching to chords, low notes, and high notes.

**If you want to improve your reading ability and familiarity with the keys, a good method is to stop looking at your hands and only focus on the sheet music**  
You will be able to learn new sheet music easier because you won't be looking up and down as much - you will have a skill for playing without looking down at your hands.

##  **How do I identify the octave I am playing in Hanon?**

**‌🧐If you are reading the music, you should be able to keep track of which note you are on.**

### **Octave Exercise**

**Familiarize yourself with the octaves for each note. Find middle C, go up an octave to the next C, and then the next C above that.**

## Struggling with sight reading more than 3 notes per bar? 

Are you frustrated because it is difficult to learn new pieces, even below your technique level?

**Read new music every day** - Pick material that is slightly lower than your current level

Learning piano without reading notes

## How can I learn to play new styles **and** freestyle?

### 1. Build up your music vocabulary

**Music is a language. Read a lot of music, play a lot of music.**   
It's like learning English. You have to read a lot of books. If you've always read non-fiction, maybe try fiction.

**Pick pieces or songs that you like.**   
Find the sheet music for them, and start learning them even if they're super easy. 

### 2. Freestyle is like writing or speaking

**If you are a 3rd grader learning English, you won't have the vocabulary or sentence structure of a 12th grader.**   
Same with Piano. You want to build up your music vocabulary by reading new music. 

**Take the elements from each piece you learn like words or phrases from each book you read.**   
You will eventually be able to freestyle your own stuff on the spot.
