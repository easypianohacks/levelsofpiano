# 🎼 Sight Reading

## Should I look at my hands, sheet music, or play by memory?

### 🤲 🎼 🧠 A pianist will do all 3

**You will look at your hands, the sheet music, and from memory**

The times when we look at our hands and the sheet music are when we are learning, to check our placement, fingering, reaching to chords, low notes, and high notes.

**If you want to improve your reading ability and familiarity with the keys, a good method is to stop looking at your hands and only focus on the sheet music**

You will be able to learn new sheet music easier because you won't be looking up and down as much - you will have a skill for playing without looking down at your hands.

##  **How do I identify the octave I am playing in Hanon?**

**‌🧐**If you are reading the music, you should be able to keep track of which note you are on.

### Octave Exercise**:**

Familiarize yourself with the octaves for each note. Find middle C, go up an octave to the next C, and then the next C above that.

## Fingering is confusing! - Is this right?

> "Is this supposed to be the same finger? I don't know if the writer pretended to write the wrong finger number or if it's just wrong."

**It's intentional...you're meant to practice switching**

## Struggling with reading &gt;3 notes per bar? 

Are you frustrated because it is difficult to learn new pieces, even below your technique level?

**Read new music every day** - Pick material that is slightly lower than your current level

## I can't read sheet music. Should I learn?

> "I can read notes but when I play I only use memory."
>
> "I practice scales, arpeggios, and Hanon, and I study melodies. In some sheet music, I do really well, and some I lose control."
>
> "I don't know what finger placement to use. Since I self-taught, I never really jumped into correct fingering. I didn't think you could have note blindness after spending forever reading sheet music."

**Sight Reading means you can play while you read with no preparation.** 

That's why we read new things every day, every week. 

Over time, you will be able to read any sheet music, no problem. 

The more new music you read, the faster you become.

## How can I learn to play new styles **and** freestyle?

### 1. Build up your music vocabulary

**Music is a language. Read a lot of music, play a lot of music.**   
It's like learning English. You have to read a lot of books. If you've always read non-fiction, maybe try fiction.

**Pick pieces or songs that you like.**   
Find the sheet music for them, and start learning them even if they're super easy. 

### 2. Freestyle is like writing or speaking

**If you are a 3rd grader learning English, you won't have the vocabulary or sentence structure of a 12th grader.**   
Same with Piano. You want to build up your music vocabulary by reading new music. 

**Take the elements from each piece you learn like words or phrases from each book you read.**   
You will eventually be able to freestyle your own stuff on the spot.
