# 🎼 Sight Reading

## I can't read sheet music. Should I learn?

> "I can read notes but when I play I only use memory."
>
> "I practice scales, arpeggios, and Hanon, and I study melodies. In some sheet music, I do really well, and some I lose control."
>
> "I don't know what finger placement to use. Since I self-taught, I never really jumped into correct fingering. I didn't think you could have note blindness after spending forever reading sheet music."
>
> "I'm a pop player, and I just play with a band, or a singer...never alone or with an orchestra. Do I still need to learn how to read sheet music?"

### Sight Reading + Ear Training + Memory = Pro

Asking whether you need to learn to play sheet music if you can already play by ear is like someone who gives speeches asking if they need to learn how to read. 

Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles didn't read sheet music because they were blind. So, you don't need to...

But if you can do it, you probably should.

To become a GOOD pianist for a band or a singer, learn to read music. Play in a band. 

You get better by practicing the thing you want to do.

### **Sight Reading with No Preparation**

### 5 Ways to Improve Sight Reading

## How can I learn to play new styles **and** freestyle?

### 1. Build up your music vocabulary

**Music is a language. Read a lot of music, play a lot of music.**   
It's like learning English. You have to read a lot of books. If you've always read non-fiction, maybe try fiction.

**Pick pieces or songs that you like.**   
Find the sheet music for them, and start learning them even if they're super easy. 

### 2. Freestyle is like writing or speaking

**If you are a 3rd grader learning English, you won't have the vocabulary or sentence structure of a 12th grader.**   
Same with Piano. You want to build up your music vocabulary by reading new music. 

**Take the elements from each piece you learn like words or phrases from each book you read.**   
You will eventually be able to freestyle your own stuff on the spot.

## Should I look at my hands, sheet music, or play by memory?

### 🤲 🎼 🧠 A pianist will do all 3

**You will look at your hands, the sheet music, and from memory**

The times when we look at our hands and the sheet music are when we are learning, to check our placement, fingering, reaching to chords, low notes, and high notes.

**If you want to improve your reading ability and familiarity with the keys, a good method is to stop looking at your hands and only focus on the sheet music**

You will be able to learn new sheet music easier because you won't be looking up and down as much - you will have a skill for playing without looking down at your hands.**How do I identify the octave I am playing in Hanon?**

**‌🧐**If you are reading the music, you should be able to keep track of which note you are on.

### Octave Exercise**:**

Familiarize yourself with the octaves for each note. Find middle C, go up an octave to the next C, and then the next C above that.

## This fingering is confusing! - Is this right?

> "Is this supposed to be the same finger? I don't know if the writer pretended to write the wrong finger number or if it's just wrong."
