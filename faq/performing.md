## How do I be more confident playing in front of people?

You'd think that a lot of practice would make you confident playing in front of people, right?

You'd think that having 3 diplomas in piano, having taught piano since 2009, I'd be super confident right?

Wrong. 

Why does this happen?

### Fear of Judgement

Why does our performance fall apart when we play in public? 

**This is the fear of judgement.** 

We perform worse in public than when we perform in private because we care what other people might think. 

We think we risk public embarrassment. We imagine everyone laughing at us for making mistakes.

### The Solution

In short:

{% hint style="success" %}
Practice **at home** = Good **at home**  
Practice **in public** = Good **in public**
{% endhint %}

You must practice performing to get good at performing.

After 20 years of playing, and having never gotten over my fear of performing in public...

I decided to brave my fears one summer day in August 2019...
