## 😩 How can I be more confident playing in front of people?

You'd think that a lot of practice would make you confident playing in front of people, right?

You'd think that having 3 diplomas in piano, having taught piano since 2009, I'd be super confident right?

Wrong. 

Why does this happen?

### Fear of Judgement

Why does our performance fall apart when we play in public? 

**This is the fear of judgement.** 

We perform worse in public than when we perform in private because we care what other people might think. 

We think we risk public embarrassment. We imagine everyone laughing at us for making mistakes.

### The Solution

In short:

{% hint style="success" %}
Practice **at home** = Good **at home**  
Practice **in public** = Good **in public**
{% endhint %}

You must practice performing to get good at performing.

After 20 years of playing, and having never gotten over my fear of performing in public...

I decided to brave my fears one summer day in August 2019...

## 😓I struggle when recording myself and playing in front of people

> 🥴 **I get performance anxiety when I'm just recording myself for other people.** It's super frustrating to **mess up way more when I record myself** than I ever do during practice.

### No Expectations

**The best way to get out of this is not to have any expectation**   
If I don't expect to play it perfectly in this take, I won't get frustrated or flustered. I just let the camera roll, and whatever good takes I get at the end of the session are the ones I post. 

### **Practice in front of other people** 

**This is usually a harder condition than practice on our own**   
In order to get good at playing in front of other people , we must do practice in front of other people.

{% hint style="success" %}
### **It's the real test of how we play...**

100% in perfect conditions  
80% in realistic conditions = We are not as fluid as we think

## 💡How can I learn to improvise?

Improvisation and variations come with practice too.

### 3 Tips to Improvise Better on Piano

### **1. Learn music theory** 

Need to understand each chord and the scale of that chord. The notes you can play that sound good should match the notes in each chord. 

🧩 Ex. A major chord \(A C\# E\) - While LH plays those 3 notes in a chord pattern, if you use the RH to play any melody, chord or arpeggio with mostly those 3 notes, it will sound good.

### **2. Master your technique** 

Chords and arpeggios can be practiced so that you can play more advanced rhythms and patterns.

🏆 If you practice the chords and arpeggios to all 12 major chords and 12 minor chords, you have a good start. Then do all 12 dominant 7th chords and 12 diminished 7th chords. **These are the building blocks to your vocabulary.**

### **3. Build up your vocabulary** 

Too many people want to improvise without first learning enough words. Improvising is like writing - if you don't know may words, the things you write will be simple. 

✒️ Start by studying other music. Take what you learn from other people's arrangements, see what chords, patterns and rhythms they use, and learn them. Once your fingers learn these new words of music, you can then try them in your own sentences to write your own musical essays. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**📇 Building "Vocabulary?"**

If you were to write an essay in Chinese, how hard would it be if you only knew 10 words? Now imagine you read 50 books, watch 100 movies in Chinese and practice using the words you learned every day for 5 years. How much better will you be able to write an essay after 5 years of improving your vocabulary?

**✨ Same with piano music. It's a language.**   
You speak with your fingers, and you learn with your ear.  

🎵Notes = Letters \| 🎹Chords = Words \| 🎶Melodies = Sentences \| 🎼Pieces = Essays
{% endhint %}

## Sometimes I completely **blank and** forget the notes during a concert or recital!

### The Quick Fix - **Memorize the ending**

I've blanked out before. Played 4 bars...stopped 😶 Silence 😳 Sweat 😰  
Jump to the bars before the ending. Take a bow. Applause.

### The Real Answer 

### **1. Laugh at it** 🤣 

From now on, you think it's funny when this happens. This makes it less serious, less traumatic. You must desensitize yourself to what people think about you. 

Remember, it's not the concert or the place it happens. It's a change in how you think. The truth is, no one cares about you. They have their own anxiety and fears.

### **2. Do crazy things in public** 😜 

You can start by doing things that make you nervous in public until you are no longer afraid of what people would say or thing of you. 

Try clapping while you walk in public. People will look at you...but only for 5 seconds, and then they will look away. 

Post a video with mistakes. I make so many mistakes when I play, even in my videos, and people don't care. The rare ones that hate on you vocally actually hate themselves. Forgive them, for they are in pain. 

### **3. The Truth is Practice**

You must practice performing in public more often. It's actually hard to get and hold someone's attention. People really don't care about you. They are too busy looking at their phones.

People want to be entertained. People are empathetic. You just need to put yourself in more situations where you can experience the applause and support for yourself so you can prove to yourself it's real.

**Do something today that puts you outside your comfort zone.**  
Record yourself, and you will inspire others living in fear. ****

## Practicing to Get Recognized

> "I'm practicing at least 4 hours daily in hopes that i will get recognized one day"

### Skill vs. Marketing

Practicing 4 hours will help your fluency

Remember to practice in front of other people by   
1. Recording video  
2. Playing live online OR  
3. In public

**Emulate the performance situation**  
You have to let more people know more about you by creating content and sharing it with the world

**Practicing more doesn't get you recognized**  
Practicing improves your skill and can help you stand out

**But the top YouTubers are not always the best Piano players**  
They are recognized because they gave the most value to the largest amount of people  
People laughed, enjoyed or learned something, so they shared their content

## How do I get more followers on TikTok? Instagram? YouTube?

Sure, nobody wants to say they want more likes, views, followers...

But if you really want to understand why some people get more attention...

If you have ever had content blow up even though you put in very little effort...

This is the journey of how I got to 100k followers on TikTok.
