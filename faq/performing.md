## How do I be more confident playing in front of people?

You'd think that a lot of practice would make you confident playing in front of people, right?

You'd think that having 3 diplomas in piano, having taught piano since 2009, I'd be super confident right?

Wrong. 

Why does this happen?

### Fear of Judgement

Why does our performance fall apart when we play in public? 

**This is the fear of judgement.** 

We perform worse in public than when we perform in private because we care what other people might think. 

We think we risk public embarrassment. We imagine everyone laughing at us for making mistakes.

### The Solution

In short:

{% hint style="success" %}
Practice **at home** = Good **at home**  
Practice **in public** = Good **in public**
{% endhint %}

You must practice performing to get good at performing.

After 20 years of playing, and having never gotten over my fear of performing in public...

I decided to brave my fears one summer day in August 2019...

### 3 Tips to Improvise Better on Piano

1. **Learn music theory** - Need to understand each chord and the scale of that chord. The notes you can play that sound good should match the notes in each chord. 

   üß© Ex. A major chord \(A C\# E\) - While LH plays those 3 notes in a chord pattern, if you use the RH to play any melody, chord or arpeggio with mostly those 3 notes, it will sound good.

2. **Master your technique** - Chords and arpeggios can be practiced so that you can play more advanced rhythms and patterns.

   üèÜ If you practice the chords and arpeggios to all 12 major chords and 12 minor chords, you have a good start. Then do all 12 dominant 7th chords and 12 diminished 7th chords. **These are the building blocks to your vocabulary.**

3. **Build up your vocabulary** - Too many people want to improvise without first learning enough words. Improvising is like writing - if you don't know may words, the things you write will be simple. 

   ‚úíÔ∏è Start by studying other music. Take what you learn from other people's arrangements, see what chords, patterns and rhythms they use, and learn them. Once your fingers learn these new words of music, you can then try them in your own sentences to write your own musical essays.
