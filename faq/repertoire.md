# üéπ Repertoire

## How long should it take to learn a piece?

### 1. Don't set an expectation

**Time to master pieces can vary greatly**  
I took an entire year to learn and master 3-5 repertoire pieces each year from 2000 to 2007.  
From 2007 to 2009, I took 2 years to master Fantasie Impromptu, Moonlight \(all 3 mvts.\), and many more.

**I never counted the days**  
I just made incremental improvements every day and NEVER expected anything.

### 2. Treat it like a video game

**We don't play a video game to enjoy it being over**  
We play to play the game. It's cool to take video of ourselves playing or sharing the game with others.

**We play the piano game for the same reasons**  
We play to experience the risk of making mistakes, fixing them, and overcoming tempo speeds like they are levels.

**The difference in quality between you and others will be how strict you are about fixing every little mistake, every shaky bit.**  

I took a 10 year break before starting @easipianohacks, and **to this day, I am still polishing things from those pieces.**

## How do I play with passion?

> Sometimes I play with passion, and sometimes not. When I don't play with emotion, I make so many mistakes. How can I prepare myself to play with passion.

**Priority is passion over everything else, but often times you need to master the craft before you can experience the passion.** 

### **1.** Master the Craft

**Craft is like sports**   
You have to do the drills, practice, and running...so you can experience the highs of playing the game and scoring a goal. How you gonna score a goal in a fierce match with dominating opponents if you don't have your basic technique down?

**The craft for piano**  
Learning what notes to play, how to read music, playing scales, music theory...so that when you perform, you don't have those mistakes holding you back.

### 2. Repetition

**Mistakes are insignificant**   
Because you can fix them easily with lots of repetition.

**We must bake the cake before the icing**  
For every piece you learn, you must first master the craft. With skill, comes the freedom to play.

### 3. Decorating the Cake

**The cake foundation is ready...time to decorate it with frosting**  
After all is fixed, you can make the melody sing, tell a story, feel an emotion in the piece you're playing. You are now at the fun part of learning a piano piece. 

1. **Play the right hand louder than the left hand** The right hand is the melody, make it sing
2. **The melody can be improved with phrasing** When the melody goes up, swell louder When the melody goes down, come down softer 

**It will sound beautiful, and you will feel the passion**

{% hint style="info" %}
**So when you practice technique and all the fundamentals, don't forget...**   
You are training for the higher purpose - to play with passion.

**Solution:** Check your notes and rhythm
{% endhint %}

### **ü§® When you encounter a difficult passage:**

1. **Count before you play üó£Ô∏è 1-2-3**
2. Start and stop on each beat if you need

   Start 1st, Stop 2nd **\|** Start 2nd, Stop 3rd **\|** Start 3rd, Stop 1st

3. **Rep it out til rhythm is perfect**
4. Once you have it down...listen to a recording and add lyrical elements like pauses
5. We must know what the rules are before we start tastefully breaking them

{% hint style="info" %}
**Craft first.** We must bake the cake before the icing.

## Tips for River Flows In You

**Are there exercises or tips I should learn before I attempt to play River Flows In You?**

1. Begin by learning to count  
2. Making sure to play the scales, chords and arpeggios in the key of the piece you will be learning will make the piece much easier to learn \(**A major and F\# minor for River Flows In You\)** 
3. You will know the most common notes that will be played in that piece, and the patterns that will be used for each chord  
4. If you can recognize music 1 chord at a time, that's 3-4 notes you're reading vs. 1 note at a time

**Also make sure to count out loud and use the metronome when you play**
