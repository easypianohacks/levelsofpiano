# ðŸŽ¹ Repertoire

## My playing isn't fluid. It sounds choppy.

{% hint style="danger" %}
As you can see Iâ€™m missing some notes and my playing is still not that fluid. 

I'm going somewhat fast here for what I should be playing, but it shows what I mean\) 

Could you please give me some advice on how to approach this piece more efficiently?

 **Solution:** Isolate & Repeat \(Repetition Game\)
{% endhint %}

### 1. Don't practice the entire piece from start to finish. Hone in and only repeat the parts you aren't fluid.

Find that 1 bar you keep screwing up on, master it by playing 10 times in a row...

...then this is the important part that separates good from excellent:

### 2. Start 2 bars before that problem bar

Get it 10 times in a row correctly  
Once perfect, then...

### 3. Start 4 bars before and get it 10x in a row

Do this for every single part you have trouble with. if you need to find where you are weak, play the piece faster than usual... and the parts you screw up you should highlight and apply the methods above.

{% hint style="info" %}
This one is a mental attitude shift

**patience**

you must do the steps in method 1 until the entire piece is perfect

**that is the game**

if there are any spots you can't do 10 times in a row correctly in time with the metronome + counting, you have weak spots.

**weak spots need to be mastered**

once all weak spots are gone, then you will have mastery, and win the game

1. Count 1-2-3
2. Stop on each beat if you need
3. Count before you play
4. Start and stop on each beat
5. Start 1st, Stop 2nd
6. Start 2nd, Stop 3rd
7. Start 3rd, Stop 1st
8. Rep it out till rhythm is perfect
9. Once you have it down...listen to a recording
10. We must know what the rules are before we start tastefully breaking them

## Are there exercises or tips I should learn before I attempt to play River Flows In You?

1. Begin by learning to count   
  
2. Making sure to play the scales, chords and arpeggios in the key of the piece you will be learning will make the piece much easier to learn   
  
3. A major and F\# minor for River Flows In You   
  
4. You will know the most common notes that will be played in that piece, and the patterns that will be used for each chord   
  
5. If you can recognize music 1 chord at a time, that's 3-4 notes you're reading vs. 1 note at a time  
  
6. Also make sure to count and play the metronome when you play
