# üéπ Repertoire

## How long should it take to learn a piece?

### 1. Don't set an expectation 

**Time to master pieces can vary greatly**  
I took an entire year to learn and master 3-5 repertoire pieces each year from 2000 to 2007.  
From 2007 to 2009, I took 2 years to master Fantaisie Impromptu, Moonlight \(all 3 mvts.\), and many more.

**I never counted the days**  
I just made incremental improvements every day and NEVER expected anything.

### 2. Treat it like a video game

**We don't play a video game to enjoy it being over**  
We play to play the game. It's cool to take video of ourselves playing or sharing the game with others.

**We play the piano game for the same reasons**  
We play to experience the risk of making mistakes, fixing them, and overcoming tempo speeds like they are levels.

{% hint style="success" %}
**The difference in quality between you and others will be how strict you are about fixing every little mistake, every shaky bit.**  

I took a 10 year break before starting @easipianohacks, and **to this day, I am still polishing things from those pieces.**

## How do I play with passion?

> Sometimes I play with passion, and sometimes not. When I don't play with emotion, I make so many mistakes. How can I prepare myself to play with passion.

**Priority is passion over everything else, but often times you need to master the craft before you can experience the passion.** 

### **1.** Master the Craft

**Craft is like sports**   
You have to do the drills, practice, and running...so you can experience the highs of playing the game and scoring a goal. How you gonna score a goal in a fierce match with dominating opponents if you don't have your basic technique down?

**The craft for piano**  
Learning what notes to play, how to read music, playing scales, music theory...so that when you perform, you don't have those mistakes holding you back.

### 2. Repetition

**Mistakes are insignificant**   
Because you can fix them easily with lots of repetition.

**We must bake the cake before the icing**  
For every piece you learn, you must first master the craft. With skill, comes the freedom to play.

### 3. Decorating the Cake

**The cake foundation is ready...time to decorate it with frosting**  
After all is fixed, you can make the melody sing, tell a story, feel an emotion in the piece you're playing. You are now at the fun part of learning a piano piece. 

1. **Play the right hand louder than the left hand** The right hand is the melody, make it sing
2. **The melody can be improved with phrasing** When the melody goes up, swell louder When the melody goes down, come down softer 

**It will sound beautiful, and you will feel the passion**

{% hint style="info" %}
**So when you practice technique and all the fundamentals, don't forget...**   
You are training for the higher purpose - to play with passion.

## Introducing Metronome to Repertoire

> "Sometimes when I try to play a new piece, it is very difficult to play with metronome, even at a low speed. Should I try harder to be able to use it at the beginning or should I add the metronome after I gets some level of mastery in the piece?"

Get fluency hands separately - üó£Ô∏è Counting out loud in the meantime

Then introduce the metronome at a slow speed as soon as you can

Like playing a video game...gotta learn the controls in the tutorial, then you can play the game at an easy speed. 

Playing with the metronome is like Flappy Bird üê¶

### Difficulty with Fingering

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2825%29.png)

**Right Hand \(RH\)**  
This fingering is helping you practice switching fingers. 

1. Go slow
2. Play one at a time
3. Play hands together at the same time

**Left Hand \(LH\)**  
Those notes are played together. See how the E is in common...  
The thumb stays there. See the fingering?

| Notes | Fingering |
| :--- | :--- |
| C E | 3 1 |
| B E | 4 1 |
| A E | 5 1 |

## **Minuet in A**

### **5 ways to make this sound better**

{% embed url="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mfg4ANMu5tnaP5Md40w0DXER5c2LHf0Y/view?usp=sharing" %}

### **1. Fix Fingering**

### **2. Follow Articulation**

Pay attention to staccatos and phrases - when to lift, when to jump

### 3. Slow Down

Go as slow as you need to play without breaks. This is a decent tempo, but there are pauses and hesitations on tricky spots

### 4. Practice the Tricky Spots

Don't practice from start to finish. Only work on the trouble areas. If you don't know wherer they are, stop when you hesitate, and circle them on the sheets

### 5. Count When You Play \(üó£Ô∏è 1+2+3+\)

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2821%29.png)

## **Is it normal to fear Liszt or Chopin?** 

**Probably / Probably Not**

Do you surround yourself with people who fear it or people who don't? 

That's the real question ‚ùìüòâ

## Stuck on a part of Grande Sonate Pathetique

{% hint style="success" %}
**Solution:** Check your notes and rhythm
{% endhint %}

### **ü§® When you encounter a difficult passage:**

1. **Count before you play üó£Ô∏è 1-2-3**
2. Start and stop on each beat if you need

   Start 1st, Stop 2nd **\|** Start 2nd, Stop 3rd **\|** Start 3rd, Stop 1st

3. **Rep it out til rhythm is perfect**
4. Once you have it down...listen to a recording and add lyrical elements like pauses
5. We must know what the rules are before we start tastefully breaking them

{% hint style="info" %}
**Craft first.** We must bake the cake before the icing.

### Hand tension playing Pirates

> "After 2 years learning Pirates of the Caribbean, the right hand is tightly clamped with a feeling of tension. Because of this, I cannot master the piece. What to do? I want to get rid of it an play freely."

**It is like trying to lift a 315 lbs weight when your muscles can only lift 20 lbs.**   
The tension is because your forearms don't yet have the muscular endurance.   
I am 21 years in with 10 years of private lessons, and I had a challenge learning this piece.  
I did scales, shords and arpeggios for 8 years with the metronome**.**

**Below is the walk-through for Pirates, but you'll want to build your foundation - Build the muscles here every day.**

## Adding Crispness and Clarity

> "Fantaisie ****Impromptu is definitely a challenge for me, but I‚Äôm proud of myself for being able to play what I can and even in the ‚Äúright‚Äù tempo. **All because I took your advice and actually for once tried playing it slowly literally a million times. Playing the same segment over and over again. First the right hand, then the left, then combined.**"

**Overall Fluency in Videos 80-90%** 

**Nice work!**   
**Got the polyrhythms down** üëå

1. More accuracy and clarity in top notes
2. Don't rush the transition part leading to the chromatic scale, keep the tempo steady \(I'm guilty of this sometimes\)
3. Hear the bass line...Some wrong notes to fix
4. Savor the moment at the top of the chromatic scale G\#
5. Savor the moment at the bottom Db leading to the arpeggios

## Tips for River Flows In You

**Are there exercises or tips I should learn before I attempt to play River Flows In You?**

1. Begin by learning to count  
2. Making sure to play the scales, chords and arpeggios in the key of the piece you will be learning will make the piece much easier to learn \(**A major and F\# minor for River Flows In You\)** 
3. You will know the most common notes that will be played in that piece, and the patterns that will be used for each chord  
4. If you can recognize music 1 chord at a time, that's 3-4 notes you're reading vs. 1 note at a time

**Also make sure to count out loud and use the metronome when you play**
