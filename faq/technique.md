# üñê Technique

## What is tension? How do I prevent it?

### There's a difference between strain and muscle soreness.  There 2 kinds of ""tension"" people refer to.

#### 1. üëé Bad Form

This is when you have bad posture, or incorrect hand form. Wrists should be level, and fingers should be curved.

#### 2. üí™ Muscular Endurance

This is the same soreness you feel when you lift a heavy weight at the gym, or run for a long time.

This is okay, and your endurance increases as you play more

Just like working out in the gym, or running outside!

**Hard time relaxing wrist and fingers when playing octaves?** Repeated broken octaves can get tiring. Once you hit your limit, just pause and shake it out. Rest. Don't keep pushing it. You'll play more accurately if you rest and recharge.

## Am I playing these scales correctly with the metronome?

## Good example of mastery over C major scale, played hands together evenly. 

### Now you can level up by:

1. Playing different keys
2. Counting subdivisions like 1+2+3+4+
3. Increasing the tempo / speed 

#### Make sure to count out loud!

## What is arm weight?

### Arm weight is a technique using the shoulder or weight of arm to play, instead of just using the fingers. To experience arm weight - do the following:

1. hold your right arm with your left hand at the wrist 
2. let go of all control of your right arm, let it go limp 
3. let go of your left hand holding your right arm
4. let your right drop onto your lap - that's arm weight
5. use arm weight when playing piano to not overstrain the fingers

{% hint style="info" %}
**Arm weight is to help you rotate your arm freely, so your arm is not stuck to your body at the sides.** You should be able to move freely and use the entire weight of your arm to play the piano when you need to play louder or softer.

## How can I learn dynamics?

Improving your dynamic range can be done with scales 

1. Find out what your quietest sound is, then find out your loudest sound

2. Then figure out how many different shades you can do in between 

3. Try to go from middle C the quietest, then crescendo all the way to the top C being the loudest, then diminuendo back down to middle C 

4. Do this slowly at first every day 10-20 times 

5. Then watch as you speed up, it gets harder 

6. Do this evenly with the metronome 

7. When we start, we have 1 shade of tone - mezzo forte 

8. As we progress, we might have 2-3 different shades of tone production   
  
a. piano   
b. mezzo forte   
c. forte 

9. Your job is to find the rest and define a difference between 

  
a. pianissimo   
b. piano   
c. mezzo piano   
d. mezzo forte   
e. forte   
f. fortissimo

## Any tips on playing smoother and faster?

Slow. 

Accuracy first, then accuracy at a faster speed. 

It's like trying to shoot an arrow while riding a horse.  
You might want to practice shooting an arrow while standing before you try the horse. 

What's the point of going fast if you miss 1 or all of your shots?  
If you don't practice slowly, your playing probably sounds like garbage.

When I don't practice slowly, my playing gets uneven. 

{% hint style="success" %}
**Here's an exercise:**  
Practice slow and accurate for 5 - 10 reps, then fast for 1 rep to test the results.

## Am I using the metronome correctly



When you are struggling to match the metronome: 

1. Slow it down so you can hear each tick match the notes \(the tempo is too fast if you are slower than the metronome\)

 2. Clap with each tick 

3. Then count AND clap with each tick

4. Then play middle C with each tick AND count 

5. Then play C major scale slowly with each tick AND count 

If you count loud while you play \(1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4\), you will match because our voices are trained more than our fingers, so we must count out loud to sync our fingers with our minds.

## How to identify what octave I am in \(C3 or C4\) while playing Hanon No. 1?

If you are reading the music, you should be able to keep track of which note you are on.

Familiarize yourself with the octaves for each note. A good exercise is to find middle C, go up an octave to the next C, and then the next C above that.

## How do I play faster with less mistakes?

You must play slow and accurately before you can play fast.
