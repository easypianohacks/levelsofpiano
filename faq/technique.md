# 🖐 Technique

## Having trouble playing hands together?

Hand Independence is a common challenge. 

When you are having trouble with coordination and speed, we call this Slow Finger Syndrome.

You can improve with the right drills every day. 

Playing both hands is just like reading English...the more books you read, the better you get. 

That's all it is. 

### 1. Play [**Czerny Opus 599**](http://imslp.simssa.ca/files/imglnks/usimg/1/10/IMSLP86518-PMLP177048-CZERNY_Practical_Method_for_Beginners_on_the_Pianoforte_Op._599.pdf) ****

**Play every day...one new exercise per week**  
They get progressively more difficult as your skill for reading improves. 

### 2. Try these 5 exercises

## How to FIX Pinky Collapsing

### 1. Build your strength using drills

**Your pinky \(finger 5\) is naturally a weaker finger, but it can be strengthened.**  
Start with Hanon No. 1 and work up to Hanon No. 31

### 2. Check your form

**You can hurt yourself if you use the wrong form.**   
Use the side/edge of your pinky as well as the point for different purposes. 

{% hint style="success" %}
**Warming up with one Hanon exercise per 1-2 weeks will help you build agility and strength.** 

Remember to use the metronome and count!

## My playing isn't fluid. It sounds choppy.

> "As you can see I’m missing some notes and my playing is still not that fluid.   
> I'm going somewhat fast here for what I should be playing, but it shows what I mean.  
> Could you please give me some advice on how to approach this piece more efficiently?"

{% hint style="success" %}
 **Solution: 🔁** Isolate & Repeat \(Repetition Game\)
{% endhint %}

### 1. Hone in on parts that aren't fluid

**🛑 Don't practice the entire piece from start to finish.**   
Find that 1 bar you keep screwing up on, master it by playing 10 times in a row...

Then, this is the important part that separates good from excellent...**⤵️**

### 2. Start 2 bars before that problem bar

Get it 10 times in a row correctly

Once perfect, then...⤵️

### 3. Start 4 bars before and get it 10x in a row

**Do this for every single part you have trouble with.**   
If you need to find where you are weak, play the piece faster than usual... and the parts you screw up you should highlight and apply the methods above.

{% hint style="info" %}
**🧠 This one is a mental attitude shift**

**Patience**  
You must do the steps in method 1 until the entire piece is perfect

**That is the game**  
If there are any spots you can't do 10 times in a row correctly in time with the metronome + counting, you have weak spots.

**Weak spots need to be mastered**  
Once all weak spots are gone, then you will have mastery, and win the game
{% endhint %}

## What is tension? How do I prevent it?

### There are 2 kinds of "tension"

There's a difference between strain and muscle soreness. 

### 1. 👎 Bad Form

This is when you have bad posture, or incorrect hand form. Wrists should be level, and fingers should be curved.

{% embed url="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IFR9v9Nyhlb\_1eQieuYgFhqUv1t1BheQ/view?usp=sharing" %}

### 2. 💪 Muscular Endurance

This is the same soreness you feel when you lift a heavy weight at the gym, or run for a long time.

This is okay, and your endurance increases as you play more

Just like working out in the gym, or running outside!

{% hint style="success" %}
**Hard time relaxing wrist and fingers when playing octaves?** Repeated broken octaves can get tiring. Once you hit your limit, just pause and shake it out. Rest. Don't keep pushing it. You'll play more accurately if you rest and recharge.
{% endhint %}

### Pain/Weakness from Poor Form

**Slow down and restart with good form**

If this habit is not fixed, it will prevent building strength and agility

If you play faster than you are able with correct form, you will feel pain and inability to relax your fingers 

Like trying to lift 315 lbs when you can only do 50 lbs with correct form

## How to play scales correctly with metronome

### Example of C Major Scale Mastery

#### Now you can level up by:

1. Playing different keys
2. Counting subdivisions like 1+2+3+4+
3. Increasing the tempo / speed 

### 🗣️ Make sure to count out loud!

## Is there a way to increase my hand span? 

{% hint style="warning" %}
### My hand cannot reach 1 octave

My teacher told me to give up and just play the way I'm able to play. 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
### **Solution -** Practice [**Hanon**](http://csokabeata.hu/Kottak/Gyakorlatok/Hanon%20-%20The%20Virtuoso%20Pianist.pdf) **Exercise 31** every day

## Sitting position when reaching for notes

> "The part I am playing takes place on the lower half of the keyboard. I tend to just stay seated by the pedals and sway in the direction I'm playing, but I'm not sure if that is how one should play.
>
> This makes me bend my hand lower than my fingers in the end, and I believe that is causing me issues."

### Turning

If it is just a small adjustment, turn or bend

On Moonlight Sonata 3rd Mvt, I bend to the left many times

### Shifting

You can move around while on the bench

No need to stay in a specific spot

Pedal on the right foot is something to get used to with practice...should only have your toes on the pedal

## 🦾What is arm weight?

**Arm weight is a technique using the shoulder or weight of arm to play, instead of just using the fingers.** 

### To experience arm weight**, d**o the following:

1. hold your right arm with your left hand at the wrist 
2. let go of all control of your right arm, let it go limp 
3. let go of your left hand holding your right arm
4. let your right drop onto your lap - that's arm weight
5. use arm weight when playing piano to not overstrain the fingers

{% hint style="info" %}
**Arm weight is to help you rotate your arm freely, so your arm is not stuck to your body at the sides.** You should be able to move freely and use the entire weight of your arm to play the piano when you need to play louder or softer. 
{% endhint %}

## How can I learn dynamics?

### Find Your Dynamic Shades With Scales

**When we start, we have 1 shade of tone - mezzo forte**   
As we progress, we might have 2-3 different shades of tone production   
a. piano   
b. mezzo forte   
c. forte 

**Find out what your quietest sound is, then find out your loudest sound**  
Next, figure out how many different shades you can do in between

**Start from middle C the quietest**  
Then **crescendo** all the way to the top C being the loudest  
Then **diminuendo** back down to middle C

**Do this slowly and evenly** _**with the metronome**_ **every day 10-20 times**  
Watch...as you speed up, it gets harder

{% hint style="success" %}
**Your job is to find the rest of the shades and define a difference between**   
a. pianissimo   
b. piano   
c. mezzo piano   
d. mezzo forte   
e. forte   
f. fortissimo
{% endhint %}

## How do I play faster with less mistakes?

### Slow 

You must play **slow** and **accurately** **before** you can play **fast**.

### Accuracy First

**It's like trying to shoot an arrow while riding a horse.**  
You might want to practice shooting an arrow while standing before you try the horse. 

### Then accuracy at a faster speed

**What's the point of going fast if you miss 1 or all of your shots?**  
If you don't practice slowly, your playing probably sounds like garbage.

When I don't practice slowly, my playing gets uneven. 

{% hint style="success" %}
### **Here's an exercise:**

Practice slow and accurate for 5 - 10 reps, then fast for 1 rep to test the results.
{% endhint %}

## Why do I make mistakes when I try to speed up my playing?

{% hint style="success" %}
#### **Level 1 is too easy for you, so it's boring**

#### **Level 10 is too hard**

#### **Why not make sure you get 100% at Level 2, 3, 4, 5...before you try Level 10?**
{% endhint %}

### Level up like a video game

Find the next comfortable tempo instead of increasing to a speed that is too difficult

Pretend your're trying to shoot arrows while running

When accuracy of 100% at 52 bpm becomes too easy, you need to find the speed where your accuracy is 90% \(e.g. 66 bpm\)

If you keep trying for 120 bpm, you accuracy is going to be 75% \(missing 3/4 shots\)

Improve the 66 bpm level to 100% before you pass yourself, and keep repeating that until you master Level 10

## ⏱When is it time to level up in speed?

### 1. Are your mind and muscles ready?

**Sometimes you need to train the mind to be okay with taking longer**   
First you need to train the mind feel the rhythm and apply proper technique

**Sometimes it's the muscles you need to build**  
Fingers take time to develop, even if your mind is ready

### 2. Can you play evenly and accurately?

**If you can't keep up with the metronome, drop it down**  
If not at 108, drop it to 88  
If not 88, drop it to 72  
If not at 72, drop it to 63  
If not at 63, drop it to 54

### 3. Does it feel challenging?

**Once a speed no longer feels challenging, find the next challenging speed that you can play evenly and accurately**   
When you keep pushing this standard every day, you will play faster and faster

{% hint style="info" %}
**The bpm at the top of the score is just a standard, NOT the tempo you should be practicing.** 

How do you know when you're ready to lift **225 lbs**? When you can lift **205 lbs \(10 reps\)** with ease.

## Having trouble with big leaps?

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkN05fFiPP0&t=50s" %}

## Why does wrist position make a difference? 

**Your wrists should be level.** If your wrists bend way up or way down, it's because your fingers aren't strong enough, and your over-compensating with your arms.

**My students play these three things every day to build technique and strength:**  

1. Scales, Chords and Arpeggios
2. Hanon
3. Czerny

{% hint style="success" %}
🏋️ **It's basically like a sport.**  
You need muscles.   
To build muscles, you need to do the drills.
