## I'm trying my best to count. What's wrong with me?

Nothing is wrong, this takes time. 

It took me 8 years to develop a decent sense of counting - I got yelled at a lot. 

1. Desire and passion are good. You'll want to channel that into your patience, and blindly do thousands or as many repetitions as necessary to get there 

2. Don't expect anything at all 

3. Just strive to improve every day and play the game 

4. Good coaching is brutally honest and raw - I don't hold back when it's wrong or decorate it for anyone's feelings 

5. If it is not good enough, I will tell you...if it is very good, you know it's amazing. - That's how we'll develop good piano players 

6. If you don't want it to hurt, don't take compliments seriously, and you won't take ""haters seriously"" - If we attach how we play to our ego, then we are vulnerable to whatever anyone says On the day-to-day, we just strive to perfect one thing at a time. 

Like painting a masterpiece, one stroke at a time.

## How do you respond negativity?

1. Keep your ego out of it 

2. No one has to be wrong...you both can be right 

3. Show empathy - No one needs to hate on haters for they are already in pain 

4. Remember that we all have our cocky moments, and everyone's been insecure at one point 

5. Lead by example
