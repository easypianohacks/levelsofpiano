## Any tips for breaking out of a rut when you stop progressing?

### Have a piano teacher look at it for you. 

Most people are impatient and don't practice enough, some people are hard working but don't know the right methods.

## I'm trying my best to count. What's wrong with me?

### Nothing is wrong, this takes time. 

#### It took me 8 years to develop a decent sense of counting - I got yelled at a lot. 

1. Desire and passion are good. You'll want to channel that into your patience, and blindly do thousands or as many repetitions as necessary to get there 

2. Don't expect anything at all 

3. Just strive to improve every day and play the game 

4. Good coaching is brutally honest and raw - I don't hold back when it's wrong or decorate it for anyone's feelings 

5. If it is not good enough, I will tell you...if it is very good, you know it's amazing. - That's how we'll develop good piano players 

6. If you don't want it to hurt, don't take compliments seriously, and you won't take ""haters seriously"" - If we attach how we play to our ego, then we are vulnerable to whatever anyone says On the day-to-day, we just strive to perfect one thing at a time. 

### ðŸŽ¨ Like painting a masterpiece, one stroke at a time.

## How do you respond negativity?

1. Keep your ego out of it 

2. No one has to be wrong...you both can be right 

3. Show empathy - No one needs to hate on haters for they are already in pain 

4. Remember that we all have our cocky moments, and everyone's been insecure at one point 

5. Lead by example

## Where can I get motivation when I am nervous for piano exams?

### I am nervous for my piano exam. Can you give me motivation?

1. If you are free from needing things to motivate you, you will be free from feeling nervous about bad outcomes.
2. Separate your feelings from life situations, and dictate how YOU want to feel at all times. Be happy because you are happy, not because you're waiting on someone to tell you to be happy.
3. If you ever need perspective, just imagine the worst thing that could possibly happen...If your parents died in a car accident, would you care about the exam?
4. Exam is a made-up thing and won't limit your future if you fail or succeed...Every exam I did no longer has any effect on my life now, but all the preparation and training I did for the exam developed the real skill I now have.

#### ðŸ¤¯ Forget the exam. You're just going there to show them how well you play. Their opinion doesn't matter over yours. It may just be helpful for you to improve.

## What motivates you to play piano when you feel like quitting?

### The chills that run up and down my spine when I really feel the emotion of a piece motivate me now, but it took going through all of the stepping stones of depression, anger, and pride to get there.

1. When I was just doing my levels in elementary school, I was super overworked and depressed and cried myself to sleep sometimes.
2. Then, I got angry. I took that anger and fueled it into my practice.
3. One day, while doing Level 8, I realized that I was pretty good at piano and took pride in it.
4. Then one day while playing the Moonlight Sonata, I really felt the emotion. The pain and the music. I channeled that energy and started imagining stories as if my playing was a soundtrack to a movie.

#### I teach now and play what I love. Developing emotional maturity takes time. 

{% hint style="success" %}
For now, start taking some time to play things you enjoy so that you have some balance, or be like me and learn to enjoy the things you don't enjoy at first. **To let go of resistance is freedom.**

## Are classically trained pianists better than casual pianists?

### No need to compare. 

#### Classical pianists usually do a lot more practice and technical drills, but that doesn't mean a casual pianist can't do the same thing or be great. You can strive to be good, but if you compare yourself to others, you will always be vulnerable to the next person that is better than you.

1. It is better to focus on being good at it for the sake of being good at it, not competing with others.
2. Tons of musical artists have no classical training, and they're still very popular and successful
3. Dr. Dre's beats have higher standards than most other rap music.
4. Ray Charles was blind and never went to music school but could perform and entertain at a very high musical level.
5. If we associate our piano skill, our follower, count or any other external measurement with our self worth, we will always be at the mercy of that metric. You will find more peace and happiness in keeping those separate from your ego.

#### At the end of the day, it feels better to focus on what you are passionate about in music rather than seeing it as a competition. When you are not better or worse than anyone, you can then find what you love to do, and you'll find that you'll naturally do it better than most people \(but by that time, you won't even want it\).
