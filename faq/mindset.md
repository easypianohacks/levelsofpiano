# 🧠 Mindset

## I'm in a rut...I've stopped progressing

> "About 2 months ago, I started to practice the first one minute of a piece, but I still cannot play it clearly.  
> I'm still not able to accompany a singer or fill in a with band with good playing.   
> I'm really in a very bad mood to practice again because I feel nothing improved in my playing even though I practiced quite a lot."

### Quantity vs. Quality of Practice

**It's like shooting 50 air balls vs. scoring 50 baskets**

### **1. Mindset Mistake**

**High Expectations = Impatience**  
Most people are impatient and don't practice enough  
  
**Quality of Reps = Progress**  
Time spent does not equal progress. 

If you just started to learn piano and can't play the right notes in time...  
Accompanying someone is going to be like trying to ride a horse 🐴 and shoot an arrow  
You must first master shooting an arrow while standing 

In this example, you're missing 8/10 shots while standing...  
Your only goal is to hit 1 more perfect shot...and another 1...until you can do all 10 in a row.

We don't need to care how much time we spend...just focus on getting one more hit 🎯...one more correct note.

That's all that matters.

### **2. Practice Strategy Mistake**

**Inefficient Method = Slower Progress**  
Some people are hard working but don't know the right methods  
  
**What you do during practice makes the difference**  
If you're just playing it over and over from start to finish...hoping the nest one will be right...  
That's a world of difference from isolating every single wrong note you play, fixing each bar, playing each problem area 10x in a row before moving onto the next bar.   
  
**All while SLOWLY counting and playing with the METRONOME**

### 3. It's like curing an illness 

You can try to cure it yourself, or you can have a doctor diagnose the illness and prescribe the treatment required  
You can try to fix it yourself, or you can have a piano teacher tell you exactly what you're doing wrong and how to practice to move forward

**Have a piano teacher look at it for you**

{% hint style="success" %}
**It doesn't matter how much you practice...If you're using a fork to drink water, it'll be harder than if you used a cup.** 

**Let's figure out how to help you.**

## Am I too old to learn piano?

People say that you have to start learning at an early age to become good at piano. **Am I too late?**

### **Never too late!** 

**My oldest students are retired...**My mom started last year and learned Fur Elise.

{% hint style="success" %}
**When people say YOU can't, it means they think THEY can't.** They're just projecting what they believe of themselves onto you. 
{% endhint %}

## Is 3.5 years too young to learn?

> "My son is 3.5 years old. Every teacher I find says it's too early to learn and won't start until age 6. 
>
> He is really passionate about playing with "fun." Now he knows where the notes are and can play by colors...like orange stands for C."

**If he likes it, he can definitely start on his own**  
I started when I was 3.5 as well

**It's just about attention span**  
Should be just sessions to hone his interest without creating any expectation of results

The beginner book I used was [**Faber & Faber: Piano Adventures**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1616770759/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=lucienlu03-20&linkId=1027edd875f1ad6ff535ab417607e915&language=en_US)\*\*\*\*

## Self-Talk and Self-Opinion

### 1. Laughing at yourself

**No one actually laughs at themselves**

It's the voices of other people you have let into your head. 

Laughing at yourself and saying you're not good enough doesn't help you improve.

### **2. True Happiness**

**If you wish to find happiness, you must stop caring what other people think of you**

From this day forward, your own opinion of yourself matters over others.

Other people don't know everything about you, so why would their opinions even matter?

People say you're not good only if they are scared of other people saying they're not good.

**Once you get this mindset fix, and you truly wish to improve, you will be ready to make more progress than you can imagine.** 

## How do I play perfectly and build confidence?

### 1. Self-confidence

**If you want to be "self" confident, YOU must be the first person to believe in yourself**  
You can't rely on playing something right or wrong to tell you if you're confident.  
You can't rely on someone SAYING you play well to tell if you're confident.

If you keep waiting on other things to give you confidence, that's not "self" confidence anymore, is it? 

### 2. Playing with all of the cheat codes

**It is no fun unless there is a challenge.** Nobody plays perfectly all of the time. Anything worth doing is hard at first. It gets easier. You get stronger.   
  
As you get better, you'll enjoy the process of finding imperfection and turning it into perfection. 

### 3. Just Do It

T**he only thing that is between you and confidence is doing the thing you fear most**   
Real confidence exists in all of us, and comes out when we take ACTION....when we do the things we know we need to but are afraid to do in the moment. 

I still feel afraid about certain things, but those quickly dissolve when I take ACTION anyway.

## Want to play but don't feel like it? 

### 1. Make it more convenient 

No need to practice for longer than you want to...many short sessions can be better than a few long sessions

30-minute sessions throughout the day are good

### 2. Inspire yourself

Watch YouTube videos that inspire you to play

You can reward yourself ****with other things if you end up starting to play

You can set up an accountability tool like recording a video every time you play

**BUT THE BEST is if you reduce friction by making it convenient**, and wanting to play directly. If you can build a habit like this, you will find momentum. It will be easier for you to start playing.

## I'm struggling to count. What's wrong with me?

### Nothing is wrong, this takes time..

#### It took me 8 years to develop a decent sense of counting - I got yelled at a lot. 

1. **Desire and passion are good** You'll want to channel that into your patience, and blindly do thousands or as many repetitions as necessary to get there  
2. **Don't expect anything at all**  Just strive to improve every day and play the game 
3. **Good coaching is brutally honest and raw** I don't hold back when it's wrong or decorate it for anyone's feelings  
4. **If it is not good enough, I will tell you** If it is very good, you know it's amazing...That's how we'll develop good piano players  
5. **If you don't want it to hurt, don't take compliments seriously, and you won't take "haters" seriously** If we attach how we play to our ego, then we are vulnerable to whatever anyone says On the day-to-day, we just strive to perfect one thing at a time. 

### 🎨 Like painting a masterpiece...one stroke at a time.

## How do you respond to negativity?

1. Keep your ego out of it 

2. No one has to be wrong...you both can be right 

3. Show empathy - no one needs to hate on haters for they are already in pain 

4. Remember that we all have our cocky moments, and everyone's been insecure at one point 

5. Lead by example

{% hint style="info" %}
**Comments are a reflection of the person commenting, not you.** People make hateful comments because they are in pain. 
{% endhint %}

## I'm nervous for piano exams

### Can you give me motivation?

1. If you are free from needing things to motivate you, you will be free from feeling nervous about bad outcomes.
2. Separate your feelings from life situations, and dictate how YOU want to feel at all times. Be happy because you are happy, not because you're waiting on someone to tell you to be happy.
3. If you ever need perspective, just imagine the worst thing that could possibly happen...If your parents died in a car accident, would you care about the exam?
4. Exam is a made-up thing and won't limit your future if you fail or succeed...Every exam I did no longer has any effect on my life now, but all the preparation and training I did for the exam developed the real skill I now have.

### 🤯 Forget the exam...

You're just going there to show them how well you play. Their opinion doesn't matter over yours. It may just be helpful for you to improve.

## What if you feel like quitting?

### "At points, the stress makes me cry."

### 1. Take a break

Listen to music that you like, or take a break completely  
Get inspired by not tnhinking about it for a while

### 2. Have no expectation

You are what you are right now  
You can only improve by doing more practice

### 3. Be unemotional about mistakes

Don't compare yourself to others or even yourself  
Treat it like a ritual, something you do every day

{% hint style="success" %}
The goals you set should be on the \# of minimum repetitions you do every day

The goals should NOT be "complete this piece by January 1, 2020" or "make no mistakes the nest time I try playing it"
{% endhint %}

## What motivates you to keep going?

### **I teach now and play what I love**

The chills that run up and down my spine when I really feel the emotion of a piece motivate me now, but it took going through depression, anger, and pride to get there.

Developing emotional maturity takes time. 

> Music has saved me from depression, helped me find love, and share this love with people around the world.
>
> If more people actually knew how much bliss I feel when I play and perform...  
> the joy of finally fixing a mistake after repeating it 1000x...  
> the chills I feel when I play the right keys at the right time...  
> More people would be happier. 
>
> If I can equip everyone willing to learn with this ability, we can all change the world.

### It took stepping stones

1. **Depression** When I was just doing my levels in elementary school, I was super overworked and depressed and cried myself to sleep sometimes. 
2. **Anger** Next, I got angry. I took that anger and fueled it into my practice. 
3. **Pride** One day, while doing Level 8, I realized I was pretty good at piano and took pride in it. 
4. **Feeling emotion in the music** Then one day while playing the Moonlight Sonata, I really felt the emotion. The pain and the music. I channeled that energy and started imagining stories as if my playing was a soundtrack to a movie.

{% hint style="success" %}
**For now, start taking some time to play things you enjoy** so that you have some balance, or be like me and learn to enjoy the things you don't enjoy at first. 

**To let go of resistance is freedom.**
{% endhint %}

## Classically Trained vs. Casual Pianists

### 🧐 Who is better? 😎

**No need to compare.** Classical pianists usually do a lot more practice and technical drills, but that doesn't mean a casual pianist can't do the same thing or be great. 

1. **Focus on being good at it for the sake of being good at it**, not competing with others 
2. **Tons of musical artists have no classical training**, and they're still very popular and successful \(Dr. Dre's beats have higher standards than most other rap music\) 
3. **Ray Charles was blind and never went to music school** but could perform and entertain at a very high musical level 
4. **Keep external measurements separate from your ego.** If we associate our piano skill, our follower, count or any other external measurement with our self worth, we will always be at the mercy of that metric. You will find more peace and happiness in keeping them separate.

You can strive to be good, but if you compare yourself to others, you will always be vulnerable to the next person that is better than you. 

When you are not better or worse than anyone, you can then find what you love to do, and you'll find that you'll naturally do it better than most people \(but by that time, you won't even want it\).

**At the end of the day, it feels better to focus on what you are passionate about in music rather than seeing it as a competition.** 

## Is it okay if I quit lessons?

> "I'm close to being an adult and also worrying about my life and career. For sure I'll never leave Piano, but the lessons is what I want to quit."

### Prioritizing Piano

You can totally learn a ton on your own  
You don't need to worry about balancing life and career

**You can do it all**

1. Some adults only play 15 min a day and still make progress
2. Spend less time on Netflix, Instagram or YouTube
3. Set a timer
4. Wake up early to play

### **Top 3 MISTAKES By Self Taught Pianists**

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeS9RI9gNJ8" %}

## My parents are skeptical of my dream to study music

> I'm 15 and realized that I want to study music. Iknow conservatory is good, but hard, so I probably want to study there. I have told this to my parents and teacher, and they seem skeptical and basically think I won't get there.   
> That worries me as it's my dream to study music.

### To follow or not to follow your dreams?

This is an age-old question. Here's what I'd say to myself. I wish I learned this earlier:

### 1. Your dreams, your money

If you want to be happy, follow your dream, but don't expect your parents to pay for your education. 

### 2. You have TIME to take risk

If you're 15, you have your whole life to figure out what you want to do. Even if 10 years later, you master music, or you fail at music...you have more than enough TIME to follow a new dream.

### 3. Don't give in

If people around you are skeptical, don't give in just to please them. Why?

Not giving in builds up your bravery and confidence.   
People who may want the best for you are insecure too, and impose their lack of self-belief onto your dream. 

**For skepticism, just be sure you don't meet hate with hate.** That is a mistake everyone makes, myself included.   
Meet hate with love. Have empathy for them because deep inside, they are in pain, and that's the reason why they inflict pain onto others. Why else would they hate? 😉

### 4. It's your dream, not theirs.

Would you rather spend 80 years appeasing your parents / teachers doing something you hate?  
Or 8 years of conflict, and then a lifetime of success? 

Lots of 80+ year olds living with regret, wishing they took that chance.

```typescript
You will work harder at your dream than anything else.
% talent + hard work = pro
How pro you become depends on how much you have of each. 

If aren't as talented, but you work hard - you have options...
but not as many as someone with both. 
```

If you aren't super tall or fast, but you work hard, you still might not play in the NBA...  
But you could be very good at coaching or teaching.

Everyone's dreams and capabilities are different, but the one thing we can all strive for...  
Try things that we believe will make us happy...whatever we feel it is.  
What anyone else thinks or says is irrelevant to your opinion.
