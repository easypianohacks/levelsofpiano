# 🧠 Mindset

## Am I too old to learn piano?

People say that you have to start learning at an early age to become good at piano. **Am I too late?**

### **Never too late!** 

**My oldest students are retired...**My mom started last year and learned Fur Elise.

**When people say YOU can't, it means they think THEY can't.** They're just projecting what they believe of themselves onto you. 
{% endhint %}

## I need to breaking out of a rut...I've stopped progressing

### Have a piano teacher look at it for you

Most people are impatient and don't practice enough

Some people are hard working but don't know the right methods

## How do I play perfectly and build confidence?

### 1. Self-confidence

**If you want to be "self" confident, YOU must be the first person to believe in yourself**

You can't rely on playing something right or wrong to tell you if you're confident. 

You can't rely on someone SAYING you play well to tell if you're confident. 

If you keep waiting on other things to give you confidence, that's not "self" confidence anymore, is it? 

### 2. Playing with all of the cheat codes

**It is no fun unless there is a challenge.** Nobody plays perfectly all of the time. 

Anything worth doing is hard at first. It gets easier. You get stronger.   
  
As you get better, you'll enjoy the process of finding imperfection and turning it into perfection.

## Want to play but don't feel like it? 

### 1. Make it more convenient 

No need to practice for longer than you want to...many short sessions can be better than a few long sessions

30-minute sessions throughout the day are good

### 2. Inspire yourself

Watch YouTube videos that inspire you to play

You can reward yourself ****with other things if you end up starting to play

You can set up an accountability tool like recording a video every time you play

**BUT THE BEST is if you reduce friction by making it convenient**, and wanting to play directly. If you can build a habit like this, you will find momentum. It will be easier for you to start playing.

## I'm struggling to count. What's wrong with me?

### Nothing is wrong, this takes time..

#### It took me 8 years to develop a decent sense of counting - I got yelled at a lot. 

1. **Desire and passion are good** You'll want to channel that into your patience, and blindly do thousands or as many repetitions as necessary to get there  
2. **Don't expect anything at all**  Just strive to improve every day and play the game 
3. **Good coaching is brutally honest and raw** I don't hold back when it's wrong or decorate it for anyone's feelings  
4. **If it is not good enough, I will tell you** If it is very good, you know it's amazing...That's how we'll develop good piano players  
5. **If you don't want it to hurt, don't take compliments seriously, and you won't take "haters" seriously** If we attach how we play to our ego, then we are vulnerable to whatever anyone says On the day-to-day, we just strive to perfect one thing at a time. 

### 🎨 Like painting a masterpiece...one stroke at a time.

## How do you respond to negativity?

1. Keep your ego out of it 

2. No one has to be wrong...you both can be right 

3. Show empathy - no one needs to hate on haters for they are already in pain 

4. Remember that we all have our cocky moments, and everyone's been insecure at one point 

5. Lead by example

{% hint style="info" %}
**Comments are a reflection of the person commenting, not you.** People make hateful comments because they are in pain. 
{% endhint %}

## I'm nervous for piano exams

### Can you give me motivation?

1. If you are free from needing things to motivate you, you will be free from feeling nervous about bad outcomes.
2. Separate your feelings from life situations, and dictate how YOU want to feel at all times. Be happy because you are happy, not because you're waiting on someone to tell you to be happy.
3. If you ever need perspective, just imagine the worst thing that could possibly happen...If your parents died in a car accident, would you care about the exam?
4. Exam is a made-up thing and won't limit your future if you fail or succeed...Every exam I did no longer has any effect on my life now, but all the preparation and training I did for the exam developed the real skill I now have.

### 🤯 Forget the exam...

You're just going there to show them how well you play. Their opinion doesn't matter over yours. It may just be helpful for you to improve.

## What if you feel like quitting?

### What motivates me

I teach now and play what I love. Developing emotional maturity takes time. 

The chills that run up and down my spine when I really feel the emotion of a piece motivate me now, but it took going through depression, anger, and pride to get there.

### It took stepping stones

1. **Depression** When I was just doing my levels in elementary school, I was super overworked and depressed and cried myself to sleep sometimes. 
2. **Anger** Next, I got angry. I took that anger and fueled it into my practice. 
3. **Pride** One day, while doing Level 8, I realized I was pretty good at piano and took pride in it. 
4. **Feeling emotion in the music** Then one day while playing the Moonlight Sonata, I really felt the emotion. The pain and the music. I channeled that energy and started imagining stories as if my playing was a soundtrack to a movie.

{% hint style="success" %}
**For now, start taking some time to play things you enjoy** so that you have some balance, or be like me and learn to enjoy the things you don't enjoy at first. 

**To let go of resistance is freedom.**

## Classically Trained vs. Casual Pianists

### 🧐 Who is better? 😎

**No need to compare.** Classical pianists usually do a lot more practice and technical drills, but that doesn't mean a casual pianist can't do the same thing or be great. 

1. **Focus on being good at it for the sake of being good at it**, not competing with others 
2. **Tons of musical artists have no classical training**, and they're still very popular and successful \(Dr. Dre's beats have higher standards than most other rap music\) 
3. **Ray Charles was blind and never went to music school** but could perform and entertain at a very high musical level 
4. **Keep external measurements separate from your ego.** If we associate our piano skill, our follower, count or any other external measurement with our self worth, we will always be at the mercy of that metric. You will find more peace and happiness in keeping them separate.

You can strive to be good, but if you compare yourself to others, you will always be vulnerable to the next person that is better than you. 

When you are not better or worse than anyone, you can then find what you love to do, and you'll find that you'll naturally do it better than most people \(but by that time, you won't even want it\).

**At the end of the day, it feels better to focus on what you are passionate about in music rather than seeing it as a competition.**
