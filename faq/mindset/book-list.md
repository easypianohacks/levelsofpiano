This book contains tactical frameworks for structuring your conversations.  
The true power of this book will not be fully realized unless you are emotionally secure. 

In the 17 years I spent in elementary to high school to university, I was afraid to raise my hand and speak. 

It was the fear of judgement. The need to feel accepted. 

The need to please others. The fear of conflict.

Now, I understand that the most attractive thing one can be is...

* the lack of need
* the courage to do what most fear
* the courage to speak your truth regardless of consequence

Good intent matters. 

If you have something desirable and don't need any help...  
People will want what you have.

Don't convince, have conviction in what you have.  
You don't beg for someone to buy your thing.   
  
You show that you have something everyone else wants, and they will want what you have.

If you can identify what someone else wants, and you show you understand what they want...  
  
They will buy from you.    

So how do you know what people want?

## How do I know what people want? Ask.

If you want the job...

If you wan the sales...

If you want something you don't have...

You have to ask.

You have to care about what others want.

You have to give them what they desire.

This book clearly explains how to do proper market research, how to understand the wants, needs, frustrations of your customer or target, so you can provide the most value to them as possible.

## How to put this into practice

Just because you understand something, doesn't mean you're good at it.

If you need something to remind you what to do each day, there's no one that comes close to this than
