# 💨 How to play faster without mistakes

## **1. You're playing too fast**

This is by far the greatest problem students have other than playing on time.

Sometimes we play faster than they can read. Sometimes we play fast when it’s easy, then slow down when it gets hard. Whatever the case, we’re going too fast for our minds to comprehend what keys we need to press.

### Solution: Play Slowly

Imagine a slow speed – you’ll probably need to go 10x slower than that. If you can’t play it slow, there’s no way you sound good – at least not as good as you could be.  
  
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. Focus on playing at a SLOW speed where you can get 100% accuracy. That’s 100% accuracy on the notes AND rhythm. 

It’s like building a house on a weak foundation – it’s not going to be pretty 5 weeks later when all your mistakes start to show. 

## **2. Your fingers are weak**

Our fingers are always weak if we haven’t practiced. Even when I stop practicing I lose strength and start to falter on technically difficult passages. 

When our fingers are weak, we lack the strength to play notes evenly. The rhythm in our playing becomes inconsistent and messy. The accuracy falls. 

### Solution: Strengthen Fingers

If you don’t have muscles, you hit the gym. Being unable to play a difficult scale or arpeggio is like trying to lift a 315 lbs weight on your fast day at the gym.

But with enough repetitions and consistent visits to the gym, you will make the journey from 5 lbs to 315 lbs in due time. 

Instead of the bench press, the exercises we mainly do in piano are:

#### 1\) 5 Finger Exercise

*  Your basic 5 note scale C-D-E-F-G 

#### 2\) Hanon

* Hanon No. 1
* Master each exercise till Hanon No. 31  

#### 3\) Technique: 

* Major Scales
* Minor Scales
* Solid Chords
* Broken Chords
* Arpeggios

Each can be done at different octaves and speeds just like squats can be done from body weight to a full-on barbell with 45 lbs plates. See below for some exercises you can do to strengthen your fingers.  

## **3. You're not counting**

If you don’t count or use the metronome when you play, I won’t teach you. 

Just kidding \(not kidding\). Whatever the case, if you don’t count, you’re likely not holding quarter notes and sixteenth notes at their full value, and you wonder why your playing doesn’t sound the same as it does on Spotify.

Rhythm is a pretty serious topic if you want to actually sound great when you play piano. Most self-taught pianists picking up the piano after following a few Synthesia tutorials usually have this problem – you’re not alone. I had this problem.

It’s probably difficult for you to keep a consistent tempo \(speed\) if you haven’t been listening to a metronome your whole life.

That’s exactly what we’re going to do.

### Solution: Count + Play with the Metronome

1. Set the metronome to a slow speed like mm = 60  
2. Clap with each tick – tock – tick – tock. 
3. Now while clapping, count: 1 – 2 – 3 – 4  
4. Without changing your speed, say “AND” in between each number.  
   ex. If you had to counting + clap 4 beats

   You say: 1 AND 2 AND 3 AND 4 AND  
   You read: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   
   You clap: 4 times

   We abbreviate “AND” with the plus “+” sign  

5. The “+” is used to count subdivisions between main beats. In this case, the main beats are quarter notes.

   Adding “+” would be counting the eighth notes to get a better understanding of how long to hold the quarter notes for.  

6. We can count the next subdivision: sixteenth notes \(1/16th\). This is as much as we usually need when counting. Below are the counting methods from quarter note to sixteenth notes.

   1           2            3            4  
   1    +     2     +     3     +     4     +  
   1 e + a  2 e + a  3 e + a  4 e + a   

7. Instead of clapping, do this with your 5 finger exercises, scales, Hanon and the musical pieces or repertoire you are practicing. 
8. If you can’t keep up with the metronome, take your time to familiarize with the notes. Just count when you play. If it’s hard, you’re going too fast. You need to be following a speed that’s easy to play in time and accurately. 
9. If you are familiar with the notes, then you’re just going too fast. Set the metronome to a slower speed than you think is slow. You’ll need to go slower and count out loud. If you count in your head, we can’t hear you.  If your mouth can’t do it, what make you think your fingers can do it reliably? If you don’t need this advice, you don’t need my help yet.  Good luck.
