# ðŸ’¡ 3 Steps to Get Piano Teacher Feedback

To level up in the app \(and in real life\), you want someone with more experience to tell you what you are doing wrong and what you're doing right.

## 3 Steps to Get Feedback

### 1. Upload Videos to the App

Your **assessed rank** can change if a piano teacher thinks you should be playing at a higher or lower level.

To get a piano teacher to find out your skill level, you must upload a video of yourself playing something.

On the Homepage, select Upload Videos

### 2. Record or Upload Video 

Choose audio or video. You may record in the app, or upload a video file.   
You can practice before sending. 

There is a 5 minute limit. Aim for 1 minute \(we can usually tell in 30 seconds\).

When you are ready to send, hit YES.   
You may upload 1 recording per submission.
