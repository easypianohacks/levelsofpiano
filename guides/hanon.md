# Hanon

## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}

## **ðŸ¤” Which exercises are best \(1-31\)?**

Do all of them

Each has a different purpose

Whichever one you havenâ€™t learned is probably the best use of your time

## **Is noted fingering intentional or optional?**

Not optional - Play fingering as written

## **ðŸŽ¼ Should I do Hanon in all keys?**

Other keys are not required because we do all the scales, chords and arpeggio

## **Iâ€™ve been playing for 10 years.** 

### **Is there still a point to play Hanon, or what else would you recommend?**

For us itâ€™s just maintenance. Just drill as necessary. 

Find a problem or weakness and strengthen it. 

Weâ€™re all slacking somewhere. Thereâ€™s always room for improvement. 

Iâ€™ve lost some hand muscle ever since I stopped doing scales, chords and arpeggios...like not going to the gym as much will result in atrophy. 

You may want to continue building dexterity by doing scales, chords, and arpeggios in all 24 keys.

## Master one exercise before starting the next

> "In your view, would that be playing at full speed or slower provided consistent in playing?"

If youâ€™re at 72 bpm and 100% accuracy...

Try for 96 bpm at 100% accuracy...

Then 112 bpm at 100% accuracy...

Then 120 bpm at 100 % accuracy

## **I take 3 days to learn Hanon exercises with both hands**

Itâ€™s basically like fitness exercise at the gym.  
  
You learn it once, and you can practice different things every day.  
  
Customize to what you need  
  
So many students donâ€™t do this enough...Itâ€™s the secret to success
