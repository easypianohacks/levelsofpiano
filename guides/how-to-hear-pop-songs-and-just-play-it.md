> As I am completely self taught I often play from sheets but always dream of being able to hear pop songs in the charts and just play it on piano. if i have right hand notes I can vary a bit with very basic left hand patterns i got to know with the time.. ****Lately i did this one. With the right hand figured out with tutorials and by ear. And than tried to make an complete own left hand which was rhythmically not so easy. What do you think? And do you have any tips resources on this whole topic? \(mainly focused on the left hand\)

## Solution

Very common [Anke Baath](https://www.facebook.com/groups/230918914342383/user/100011406889377/?__cft__[0]=AZUJ7-kK574cmaw33XcsJvx_xRgAy8ePYjiTnrYlEKXbxgnS2BkvrGZnSuq4xXokEqDNmVtJRVEDeLjPB7VgdpD-V30nc9s_XyUCdLd3gmVcJuKy709cdxUCzBTLg6jB0z32siaPP4ykP1BAXcnx37usXCIqelUKywry2z_CSlo_bDEG0oXaf200ElZ4w07NC3tX-zDLIFcxRpB8eNgqUVvQ&__tn__=R]-R). 

To be able to hear any song and play it back requires 2 to 3 things:

### 1. Ear Training

 knowing what notes are being played, and being able to play back melodies. Helps if you have perfect pitch

### 2. Chords

 This is a combination of learning chords from technique and music theory. Music is made of chords. Each note in the melody belongs to a note in a chord. Some chords go well together, some don't.

I would begin by studying what chords are used in each of your favorite songs.

It's harder to improvise and make your own cake if you haven't studied how other chefs make cakes. It's harder to write a book if you haven't read enough books.
