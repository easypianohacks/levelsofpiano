## ‚úÖ Leveling Up

Each time you upload a new video for feedback, we assess if you level up in the app. 

Everyone comes in wanting to play their dream piece. 

* Pirates of the Caribbean
* Fur Elise
* Chopin Nocturne
* Clair de Lune
* Any dream piece...

Once you've played your dream piece you will have a video. You graduate by playing that dream piece. You can play piano in public or upload a video to IG / YouTube ![&#x1F642;](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t4c/1/16/1f642.png)
